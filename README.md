# Java_data_container
the project consists in designing, implementing and documenting the SecureDataContainer &lt;E> collection. SecureDataContainer &lt;E> is a container of type E objects. Intuitively the collection is constituted as a species Data storage for data specification and sharing (represented in the simulation from type E objects). The collection guarantees a Data Security mechanism providing its own user identity management mechanism. Furthermore, it provides a mechanism for access control that allows the data owner to perform a selective restriction access to your data included in the collection. Some users can be set by the owner to access the data, while others cannot access it without authorization.
